# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
This program uses OOP to find the shortest distance from a node to node using dijkstra's algorithm

This program uses a combination of object-oriented programming (OOP) 
and Dijkstra's algorithm to solve the problem of finding the shortest path 
between two cities based on data provided in a CSV file. It demonstrates 
key OOP principles like inheritance (in ItalyMap), and it effectively uses 
dictionaries and sets to manage graph data and compute shortest paths.
